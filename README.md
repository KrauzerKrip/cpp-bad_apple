Memory file with Bad Apple frames: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BNI4y6cVUjzSsZBZMib3NMVfyzT1q3Jb/view?usp=sharing

It is my [old python project](https://github.com/KrauzerKrip/python-bad_apple.git) which i translated into C++ using ChatGPT (it wrote the base).

There is not ogg file with music, because I am afraif of copyright, but you can easily take somewhere this audio, drop it into the projct folder and rename the file to "bad_apple.ogg".
