# cpp-bad_apple

## Dependencies:
>  [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML.git) (use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg?ysclid=lcxsktfzur192198285))
    
You need to replace placeholders of MUSIC_PATH and MEMORY_PATH constants to the paths to the music (ogg format) and the memory file with the frames ([here it is](https://drive.google.com/file/d/196zZLOYRyc7w06OcM6ubfYUmZN5I-AMN/view?usp=sharing)).

It is my [old python project](https://github.com/KrauzerKrip/python-bad_apple.git) which i translated into C++ using ChatGPT (it wrote the base).

There is not ogg file with music, because I am afraif of copyright, but you can easily take somewhere this audio, rename the file to "bad_apple.ogg" and don`t forget to type the path into the constant.
